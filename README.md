# Swift Song Seach
Swift Song Search is a pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript search engine of Taylor Swift's catalog. It is currently managed entirely by one person (hi I'm syd), but I hope to add collaborators in the future as the project grows, as I have pretty grand ambitions for this project.
## Current Version: 1.0.1
Released: 1/2/23
### Patches
- Fix producer search glitch
- Fix duplicate result glitch
### Catalog
- All studio albums with some remixes
- Both rerecordings, excluding All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Sad Girl Autumn Version) and All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Short Film Version)
- The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection and Beautiful Eyes
### Features
- Field search by song title and by writer
- Filter by album
- Filter by collection/type of album (studio album, rerecording, EP)
- Filter to only show songs that Taylor owns
- Filter to only show tracks Taylor wrote herself (self-written tracks)
- Filter to exclude alternate versions (remixes, demos, acoustic versions, etc)
- Click result to show/hide more song information
- Fully responsive
### Notes
- If there is a Taylor's Version of a track, the original recording is considered an alternate version
- All Too Well and All Too Well (10 Minute Version) are considered unique tracks
- You can combine any number of filters
- You can combine field searching with filters, or leave the search field blank to filter the entire catalog
